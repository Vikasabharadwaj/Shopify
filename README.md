|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Total Sales** | `Total Sales = SUM(shopify_sales[Total Price Usd])` | Calculates total revenue from all sales. |
| **Total Orders** | `Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_sales[Order Number])` | Counts the number of unique orders. |
| **Total Customers** | `Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_sales[Customer Id])` | Counts the number of unique customers. |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | `Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])` | Shows the average value of an order. |
| **Average Quantity Per Order** | `Average Quantity Per Order = AVERAGE(shopify_sales[Quantity])` | Displays the average number of items purchased per order. |
| **Total Tax Collected** | `Total Tax Collected = SUM(shopify_sales[Total Tax])` | Shows total tax amount collected across all sales. |

---

## Customer & Product Measures

| **Customers by State** | `Customers by State = DISTINCTCOUNT(shopify_sales[Customer Id])` | Measures unique customers across different states. |

---

## Payment & Gateway Measures

| Measure | DAX Formula | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Revenue by Gateway** | `Revenue by Gateway = SUM(shopify_sales[Total Price Usd])` | Shows total revenue generated via each payment method. |
| **Revenue by Gateway %** | `Revenue by Gateway % = DIVIDE([Revenue by Gateway], CALCULATE([Revenue by Gateway], ALL(shopify_sales[Gateway])))` | Calculates the percentage share of each payment gateway in total sales. |
